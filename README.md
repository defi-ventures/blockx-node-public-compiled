# How to add blockxd path for it to be accessible system-wide
In the example below, blockxd is in /root/go/bin
```
export PATH=/root/go/bin:$PATH
source ~/.bashrc
```


# How to add a key 
```
blockxd keys add <your key name> --keyring-backend file --algo eth_secp256k1
# e.g.  blockxd keys add mykey --keyring-backend file --algo eth_secp256k1
```
It will prompt you to create a keyring passphrase, make sure you remember it as you're going to need this for every transactions. After entering the passphrase, it will give you your address together with a recovery phrase, make sure to have a copy of it. You can use this passphrase to import your key/wallet to another wallet like Metamask.
